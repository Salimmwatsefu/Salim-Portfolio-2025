overview: |
  Redhot Africa, an imprint of Storymoja Publishers, curates culturally rich books, anthologies, and learning resources that celebrate African stories and voices. I built a dedicated digital platform that serves as a vibrant hub for showcasing their books, events, campaigns, and organizational details, making their work more accessible to a wider audience.
technology:
  - React JS
  - Framer Motion
  - TypeScript
  - Zustand
  - Calendly
problem: |
  The challenge was to design and develop a platform that not only highlights Redhot Africa’s diverse collection of books but also captures the cultural depth and energy of their events and campaigns. The site needed to be both engaging and easy to navigate, balancing a modern feel with a cultural identity that resonates with readers, educators, and the broader community.
role: |
  As the sole developer and UX/UI designer, I handled the project end-to-end — from concept and wireframing to design, front-end development, and deployment. I focused on translating Redhot Africa’s vision into a functional and immersive digital experience that authentically reflects their cultural mission.
solution: |
  To address the challenge, I focused on three core areas:
  
  1. **Cultural & Engaging Interface:** Designed a visually striking yet clean interface, integrating vibrant colors and cultural motifs to reflect the African identity behind Redhot Africa’s books and events.
  
  2. **Organized Content & Discovery:** Structured the platform into clear sections (Books, Events, Campaigns, About) so users can easily explore Redhot Africa’s offerings and find relevant information without friction.
  
  3. **Performance & Interactivity:** Developed with React and TypeScript for scalability and maintainability. Used Framer Motion for smooth animations, Zustand for efficient state management, and integrated Calendly for scheduling. The site is responsive, fast, and optimized for accessibility across devices.
