overview: |
  My Soul’s Universe is a Nairobi-based coaching and training platform focused on personal development and mental wellness. Their website serves as a digital hub, presenting transformative programs and resources that empower individuals to unlock their potential and achieve holistic well-being.
technology:
  - React JS
  - Framer Motion
  - Typescript
  - Zustand
problem: |
  In the coaching and wellness space, a digital presence must inspire trust, clarity, and accessibility. The challenge was to design and build a site that feels warm and approachable, while also clearly communicating the platform’s diverse offerings. The site needed to seamlessly guide users from exploration to booking sessions or training programs, without overwhelming them with information.
role: |
  I led the front-end development and user experience design, collaborating closely with stakeholders to capture the platform’s vision. My responsibilities included shaping the design language, building reusable UI components, structuring the site’s navigation, and ensuring the application delivered both performance and accessibility across devices.  


solution: |
  To achieve this, I focused on three pillars:

  1. **Inviting & Calm UI:** Designed a clean, minimalist interface with a soothing palette and balanced typography to reflect growth, clarity, and transformation.
  2. **Clear Navigation & Structure:** Organized the site into intuitive sections (Home, About, Programs, Contact), making it easy for visitors to discover the platform’s mission, coaching services, and training opportunities.
  3. **Performance & Engagement:** Built with React and Typescript for maintainability, enhanced with Framer Motion animations for subtle interactivity, and powered by Zustand for state management. The site is optimized for fast loading and fully responsive across all devices.
