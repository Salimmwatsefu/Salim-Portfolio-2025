problem: |
  The healthcare industry, especially mental wellness, requires a digital presence that builds immediate trust and feels accessible. The challenge was to design and develop a website that is not only fast and responsive but also conveys a sense of calm, compassion, and professionalism. The site needed to effectively present complex services in an easy-to-understand format while guiding users seamlessly toward scheduling a consultation, all without feeling clinical or intimidating.
role: |
  As the lead front-end developer and UX/UI designer, I was responsible for translating the clinic's vision into a fully functional, responsive, and user-friendly website. My work involved everything from initial wireframing and design to final development and deployment.

solution: |
  To address the challenge, I focused on three core areas:
  
  1. **Calm & Clean User Interface:** I designed a minimalist UI with a soft color palette and ample white space to create a serene and welcoming user experience. The typography was chosen for its high readability and professional feel.
  
  2. **Intuitive Navigation & Structure:** I organized the website's content into clear, logical sections (Home, About, Services, Contact). This allows users to easily find information about the clinic's approach, services, and partners without feeling overwhelmed.
  
  3. **Performance & Accessibility:** The site was built with React and Typescript for a robust and maintainable codebase. I used Framer Motion to add subtle, smooth animations that enhance the user experience without sacrificing performance. The final application is fast-loading and fully responsive, ensuring accessibility across all devices.
